# my html unit 

oh boy, what a unit. i look at the code now and i can say one thing, poorly written code SUCKS. so do what you want with my code, but i do not reccomend using it. we had a bunch of lessons but i only bothered to keep the assignment due to the lessons not really being html code, just videos.

## assignment 1 

lists! this lesson was the easiest but the worst. i aboslutely hated using tables, i fucking HATED tables. i'll never use them again in any sort of project. but lists were easy enough to work with. 

## assignment 2 

this is where we actually started to work on css. the previous lesson wasn't supposed to have css, but since i already had prior knowlege of working with html and css when i walked into that class, i said `fuck it, i'll add some css`. we were given a picture of a website and told to recreate it. nothing was given to us! but since i really was passionate about it, i made a 1:1 recreation of the website. down to the text (that was blurry because it was an old pic) and the picture of the gila monster. i got a 110% on that assignment TvT

## assignemnt 3

this one is not going to be listed because the teach was sick that day and just emailed us a spreadsheet to work on.

## project 1

we were supposed to make a resturant! if you noticed, all the other assignemnts had inline code in them and stuff. if there was pictures it was href'd (yes i made that up) from another website. well i had a genius idea. at the school where i took this class, they gave us windows pcs. i decided it was a good idea to run an apache web sever from my school computer and make my website! now, how was i gonna turn this in? give the teach a text file with the github repo where my code was stored and a website url where i had the website at! he was super impressed and i showed him my [personal website](https://jackpurrin.me). gotta say the teach was super chill! i got his email and he told me to email him if i ever needed a professional reference. thanks for your back mr.pound!
