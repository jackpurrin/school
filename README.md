# a repo full of my school projects

first semester of software and app 1, we did a lot of langs. but the one i did most projects in was small basic. 
software at the school i took it at was only one semester, like all the classes. 
now i'm in a school where all the classes are one year long.

next year, in my sophmore year, i enrolled for ap software and app design 2. we should be doing a lot of stuff in java.
