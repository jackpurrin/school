# school-sb-projects
this is a repo full of my projects that we did while learning small basic.

all of these are free to use if you need to use them for learning, as a reference, or a base for one of your projects.

### lesson 1
we discussed the differences between `write` and `writeline`

### lesson 2
we did a small project that would do alot of math equations using the `math` operations.

### lesson 3
uses `elseif` statements to make a small two truths and a lie game, but i won't post that.
i did post another project i did do for the `elseif` project tho, my guess the number game.
just look at the source code, it's nearly impossible to beat without automation.

### lesson 4
we did a small project that the teacher decided not to finish, it was a chat bot.
it was gonna take too long to complete aka more than a day, but that didn't stop me from getting as far as i could in the time frame that i had.

### lesson 5
we had to learn how to make some art using the small basic graphics engine. he wanted us to make it static, but i thought it would be cool to have it random every time you opened it.

### lesson 6
this was our final project and our biggest. we had to make a maze game.
the teacher knocked down the criteria for the project AFTER i had completed it, but that was no big deal though. it ended out pretty cool and i got a bit of extra credit.

### personal projects
just made these beacause i was bored in class and had nothing else to do.
they might be useful in the future though, as they are small, and take little power to run.
