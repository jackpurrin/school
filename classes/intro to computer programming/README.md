# intro to computer programming

the beginner class to the computer programming / comp-sci course!

i did this class during the first semester of my freshmen year. it was an alright class. the teacher was super chill, but not very many people in the class really cared about the class which was disappointing. 

i don't have much to write about as i took this class a year ago, but all in all, it was a super chill class. i liked it and it was fun!
