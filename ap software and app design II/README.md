# ap comp-sci II

LETS FUCKING GO IT'S AP COMP-SCI TIME!!!!!!

by the way, when i say comp-sci or something along the lines of it, it's the same thing as software and app design. just a shorter name for it!

wow i'm excited for this year! my teach is chill, the material will hopefully be fun and stuff, and maybe the students in the class will be chill. they're all juniors so i *hopefully* won't be too out of place.

i technically skipped software and app design I, but it's the same thing as intro to computer and programming. (the names of the courses are different because i went to different schools in the middle of my freshmen year. long story...)

we're gonna learn python and shit, and once i get real shit done, i'll put them here!
